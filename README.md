**Methodologies_lab1**

This program was created to solve quadratic equations with structure $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where $a \neq 0$, where a != 0.
The program has an interactive and a non-interactive mode.
In interactive mode, user must input the variable parameters by hand, using the terminal.
In non-interactive mode, user can use a prewritten file with input parameters.

*Use guide:*

1. Clone the repository using ```git clone https://github.com/GddgdgMen/Methodologies_lab1```
2. If you dont have node, install from the official site: https://nodejs.org/uk
3. Run the program by using node
```node main.js``` for interactive mode,
```node main.js <file path>``` for non-interactive mode.

```Note! The file must contain the following formatting:
1\s2\s3\n, where /s is a space and \n is a newline symbol.
```
